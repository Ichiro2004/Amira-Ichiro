      `1. Hi mommy, I want to sincerely apologize, not because I don’t trust you, but because I was honestly scared. I love you so much, and sometimes my fear and jealousy get the best of me. I know that has hurt you, and I don’t want to keep repeating the same mistakes. I promise to do better, to trust you more, and to support the things that make you happy. Thank you for being patient with me even when I fall short.

I'm truly sorry, love. I didn’t mean to hurt you or make you feel controlled. The truth is, I just love you deeply, and the thought of losing you makes me act out of fear. But I know you deserve freedom, happiness, and peace in our relationship. From now on, I’ll work on giving you that trust and understanding. You are the only one I see in my future, and no matter what happens, I will never leave you.

I want to be with you for the rest of my life. I know I’m waiting for you, and you know that too. I’ll be patient until the day we finally meet and see each other  that will be the happiest and most unforgettable moment of my life. I don’t want us to break apart because I still believe in our plans and dreams together. I love you so much, Amara Shane, and I’m sincerely sorry. I want to fulfill everything we dreamed of, including the family we talked about, and I will do everything to make that happen with you.`,
      `2. Hi my love, today is the first day of the ber  months September 1st. Happy ber months, my love. I want to spend these months with you, and I pray we’ll be together for Christmas and New Year, and for many more Christmases and New Years to come. I’m always here for you no matter what happens, and just like I always tell you that I love you so much, my mommy Amara.

We’ve dreamed of building our family together, raising our future little Ichiro and Amira, and I can’t wait for that day to come. I want to be your husband, to love you until my very last breath, and even beyond this life. You are the only one I’ll ever love, from now until forever.

I love you deeply, and I will never leave you no matter what problems come our way. I will never allow you to feel alone or hurt. I will never get tired of loving you. I will always stay by your side and wait for you patiently. I promise to always give my best for us, my future Mrs. Eballo. 🫶🏻

I love you so much, my love. Happy first day of September, and happy start of the ber months. Mwahh, I love you endlessly! 💋❤️`,

I love you, I love you so much, my love. I’m always by your side, whether I’m busy or not. I’ll always wait for you, care for you, and love you every year, every month, every day, every hour, every second.

No matter what challenges come our way, I will never walk away. You’re my everything, my reason, and my home. I’ll stand by you through the good and the bad, through your smiles and your tears. You will never have to face anything alone because I’m here, holding on to you.

I love you endlessly, mommy, and nothing will ever change that. 🥺❤️`,
      `4. Happy Birthday, my Love!🥳💖

Today you turn 23, and I’m so thankful that I met you. You’ve given me so much joy, love, and comfort, and I want you to know how much you truly mean to me. I know we’ve had misunderstandings before, but what matters is that we always find a way to listen to each other and fix things together. That’s one of the many reasons why I love you so deeply.

You are my strength, my safe place, and my greatest blessing. Whenever I’m stressed, sad, or angry, everything fades away the moment I get to talk to you, play with you, or just hear your voice. You make me feel at my best, and I will never stop being grateful for you.

Love, I want to promise you this, I will never leave you or let you face your problems alone. I will always be by your side through hardships and happiness. I will support your dreams, understand your busy days, and wait patiently because being with you is worth everything.

I know we’re still taking things slowly, but my heart is already sure of one thing. I want a future with you. I want to marry you someday and build the family we’ve both dreamed of. I want to love you, take care of you, and grow with you for the rest of my life. You are the only woman I will ever love, and nothing will change that.

Thank you for letting me love you, Amara Shane Chan Tuvilla. You’re my everything, and I will keep choosing you every single day. Happy birthday, my love! 🎂❤️ I love you so much today, tomorrow, and for the rest of my life.`,
      `5. Good morning, my love. I know we’ve had many misunderstandings, but thank you for always trying to fix things with me and for listening to each other’s side. I’m happy that I always get to play games with you and talk to you. I love you so much.

Also, I’m sorry if sometimes we lose in the game, if I get “feed,” or when I’m not in the mood. I’m sorry, love. I always do my best to win because I know it affects your mood when we lose. You may not say it or show it, but I can feel it. I don’t want that to happen to you or to us.

Everything I say to you, I mean seriously. I know it might be too early to say these things, and it’s not easy, but we’ll take it slowly, love. I want to be with you. Please always tell me if you’re not okay—I’ll be here to listen, through hardships and happiness, and I’ll be by your side.

I know we’re not officially “together” yet, but I’m willing to wait, to support your dreams and plans in life, and to love you even when you’re busy or working. You’re my strength and my safe place whenever I feel stress, depression, or anger—because all of that fades when I feel your love. Allow me to u know me more, to see my strengths and weaknesses, while I wait for the day that we’ll finally be together, chasing our shared dreams.

I will love you and do everything I can for our plans. I’ll never get tired of being with you and loving you. Don’t worry about me—I’ll always be fine, because I know I have a beautiful future girlfriend who truly loves me. Thank you for giving me the chance to love you. I’ve already fulfilled one of my dreams—that you like me and love me too.

I know you’re not ready yet, but I also know you love me and care so much for me. You’re such an important girl in my heart, and I don’t want to lose you. And love, if ever I become hard-headed, playful, or if I fail to control my anger, please—I beg you—don’t leave me, don’t let go of me. 🥺 Please, I’m begging you, it would be so hard for me to bear. Yes, I may be strong, but I also have my weaknesses ☹️.

I love you so much, Amara. I love you deeply, Amara Shane Chan Tuvilla. I’m willing to wait, to walk with you, and to stay with you until the day comes when I finally marry you 🥹.

I love you, I love you so much 🥺😘`,

My intentions are never to cause you pain—it’s just that I love you too much and fear losing you. But I’m learning every day to be better, to trust you more, and to give you the peace you deserve. You’ve been so patient and understanding with me, and I will forever be grateful for that.

One day, love, I promise all our waiting will be worth it. I can’t wait for the time when we finally see each other, hug each other tight, and make our dreams a reality. We’ll build our own home, raise our children, and create memories that will last a lifetime. Until that day comes, I’ll love you faithfully and endlessly from a distance, because distance will never change how deeply I feel for you. You are my one and only, my Amara, my future Mrs. Eballo.❤️.`
